# Bear Maps

Bear Maps is an interactive map of Berkeley. This is a project from UC Berkeley CS61B - Data Structures & Software Engineering taught by Josh Hug in Spring 2019. I completed this project as a self-learning exercise to gain hands-on experience. This project has several features including route planning, autocomplete search bar, and zoom and drag. Data from OpenStreetMap was used in this project.
